# Notes
- The latest release has yet no licence neither for the java code nor for the MS-VS .exe utilities. The utility is now stand-alone, but this will change due to the aforementioned problems, and will require the user either to install MS-VS or to manually download the required software. In the future this may be fixed making udngui automatically check & download the required software.
